## WAMP vs XAMPP

In these acronyms W stands for Windows and X stands for Cross-Platform
(Linux, Mac and Windows). The remaining letters stand for Apache (the
Web Server), MySQL or MariaDB (the Database Server) and PHP (the scripting
language used for Web development). The final P in XAMPP stands for Perl
(another scripting language).

You can install each of these software packages independantly on your platform
of choice. However, it is often more convenient to install a package that
bundles all of the separate items together. So XAMPP works on the three major
platforms but WAMP only works on Windows. Aprt from that, they do the same
job. They allow you to install and manage your local development environment.

XAMPP is covered in a separate article:
* [Local Hosting with XAMPP](jdocmanual?article=user/hosting/local-hosting-with-xampp "Local Hosting with XAMPP") for Linux, Mac and Windows.
