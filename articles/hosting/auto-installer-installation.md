## Overview

Some hosting companies offer script installers for commonly used website
software such as Joomla!. This allows someone to Install Joomla! on a
hosting server easily. There is no need to create a database, upload
files or configure the programs for use. All things are done by these
*Auto Installers* with a small amount of interaction. This article
covers two of the most commonly offered automatic script installers:

- Fantastico
- Softaculous

<div class="alert alert-warning">The gurus who offer help and advice in the
Joomla Forums recommend avoiding auto installers. They can be troublesome
and you learn nothing about the Joomla architecture. It only takes a few
minutes to set up a database and install Joomla in separate steps.</div>

## Installation on cPanel

1.  Login to your cPanel account.
2.  Look for Fantastico or Softaculous in the Category *Software / Services*
    and select its icon or name.

## Fantastico

1.  On the left hand side of Fantastico there is a *Content Management*
    Category containing Joomla!.
2.  Select the *New Installation* Link in the Joomla! Overview
3.  Fill in the various details and Submit. For each step keep selecting Submit!
