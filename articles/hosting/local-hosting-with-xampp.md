<!-- Filename:  / Display title: Local Hosting with XAMPP -->

## Introduction

XAMPP is an easy-to-install package that bundles the Apache web server,
PHP, XDEBUG, and the MySQL database. This allows you to create the
environment you need to run Joomla! on your local machine. The latest
version of XAMPP is available at the
[Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) web site. Downloads
are available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Download the package
for your platform.

*Important Note Regarding XAMPP and Skype:* Apache and Skype both use
port 80 as an alternative for incoming connections. If you use Skype, go
into the Tools-Options-Advanced-Connection panel and deselect the 
*Use 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections* option. If Apache
starts as a service, it will take 80 before Skype starts and you will
not see a problem. But, to be safe, disable the option in Skype.

## Installation

Installation on any platofrm is very simple - use the Installer. There is no 
real manual or handbook for XAMPP. The documentation is in the form of FAQs 
linked from the Downloads page. 

### Installation on Windows

For Windows, it is recommended to install XAMPP in "c:\xampp" (not in
"c:\program files"). If you do this, your Joomla! (and any other local
web site folders) will go into the folder "c:\xampp\htdocs". (By
convention, all web content goes under the "htdocs" folder.)

If you have multiple http servers (like IIS) you can change the xampp
listening port. In \apache\conf\httpd.conf, modify the line Listen 80 to
Listen \[portnumber\] (ex: "Listen 8080").

To install XDebug: [XAMPP - XDebug Setup for PHP 8](https://odan.github.io/2020/12/03/xampp-xdebug-setup-php8.html)

### Installation on Linux

#### Install XAMPP

The Download page downloads an installer xampp-linux-x64-8.2.12-0-installer.run
where 8.2.12 is the latest version. Run the installer file to install Apache2, 
MySQL and PHP.

After installation use the following commands to start and stop the services:
```sh
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop
```

#### Test your XAMPP localhost server

Open your Browser and point it to

    http://localhost

The index.php will redirect to

    http://localhost/xampp

There you will find instructions on how to change default
usernames/passwords. On a PC that does not serve files to the Internet
or LAN then changing the defaults is a personal decision.

#### Get Joomla

* Download the latest Joomla installation zip
* Unzip to your hard drive
* Connect to localhost with an FTP client Default
* Create a folder for your Joomla on the localhost server
* FTP the unpacked Joomla installation files to the newly created Joomla folder.

##### Important:

- The xammp installation sets the correct Ownership of the files and permissions.
- Using the **CHOWN command** will **cause Ownership problems with xampp**.
- **Using nautilus** to manipulate folders/files on localhost will
  **cause Ownership problems with xampp**.

#### Database information

- Host: localhost
- Default Database name: test
- Default Database user: root
- Default Password: There is **no** default Password.
- Administrator password: your choice.

Installing Sample Data is recommended for the novice user.

After installation delete the installation directory and point your
Browser to: `http://localhost/yournewjoomlafolder` or
`http://localhost/yournewjoomlafolder/administrator`.

#### Creating a link in the Ubuntu menu

##### To create a GUI for xammp connected to your Ubuntu menu

Open up the Terminal and type

    sudo nano /usr/share/applications/xampp-control-panel.desktop

Then copy the following into the nano editor and save.

    [Desktop Entry]
    Encoding=UTF-8
    Name=XAMPP Control Panel
    Comment=Start and Stop XAMPP
    Exec=gksudo "python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py"
    Icon=/usr/share/icons/Tango/scalable/devices/network-wired.svg
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    Categories=GNOME;Application;Network;
    StartupNotify=true

If the control panel fails to launch, try running the Exec command
directly in the terminal:

    gksudo "python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py"

If you receive the error:

    Error importing pygtk2 and pygtk2-libglade

Install the missing libraries:

    sudo apt-get install python-glade2

#### XDebug PHP debugger

The XAMPP package for Linux does not include the XDebug PHP debugger.
To install XDebug on Debian or Ubuntu:

- Install the *build-essential* package:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install autoconf

- Download the [development package](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html)
for your version of XAMPP and extract it over your existing installation:

    sudo tar xvfz xampp-linux-devel-1.7.7.tar.gz -C /opt

- Build XDebug:

    wget http://xdebug.org/files/xdebug-2.1.3.tgz
    tar xzf xdebug-2.1.3.tgz
    cd xdebug-2.1.3/
    /opt/lampp/bin/phpize

After this you will have following output on your consoleâ€¦

    Configuring for:
    PHP Api Version:         20090626
    Zend Module Api No:      20090626
    Zend Extension Api No:   20090626

    ./configure --with-php-config=/opt/lampp/bin/php-config
    make
    sudo make install

Then the output will be this.. please monitor the directory specified.

    Installing shared extensions:     /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/

Create a folder in your temp folder that will holds the data file
generated by XDebug:

    sudo mkdir /opt/lampp/tmp/xdebug
    sudo chmod a+rwx -R /opt/lampp/tmp/xdebug

Alternative installations:

Install using PHP extensions community library (PECL) bundled with
xampp:

    sudo /opt/lampp/bin/pecl install xdebug

On Ubuntu/Debian you can install using:

    apt-get install php5-xdebug

(warning: this will also install Apache and PHP from apt repositories).

##### Warning for 64bit users

When compiling XDebug or installing via apt-get, you will receive an
error when (re)starting xampp:

    /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/xdebug.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64

This is because xampp runs 32bit but XDebug is 64bit. To overcome this
problem, either make xdebug.so on a 32bit machine or download it from:

    http://code.activestate.com/komodo/remotedebugging/

Download the file: "PHP Remote Debugging Client" for "Linux (x86)"
Extract the content of the file on your computer, this compressed file
contains several folders with version numbers ex: 4.4, 5.0, 5.1 ... 5.3
and so forth, get in the folder with the higher version number or the
one that works for you, then manually copy the file "xdebug.so" to the
following location, overwrite if needed

    /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/

Remember this location could be different on your computer

### Installation on Mac OS X

Mac OS X actually includes an Apache server out-of-the-box, but most
developers will prefer to use the integrated tools and configurability
provided by XAMPP.

As with most programs on Mac, installation is a breeze. Visit the
[Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/) web site and download the
installer (xampp-osx-8.2.4-0-installer.dmg). Double click the downloaded
installer to start the installation process.

To start the server, open "XAMPP Control.app" and press the start button
next to Apache.

#### A Little Troubleshooting

Many Mac users have a little difficulty at this stage when trying to set
up another instance of Apache on their machine. If you cannot start
XAMPP's Apache, you have two options:
**You can change the listening port of XAMPP.** In
\Applications\XAMPP\xamppfiles\etc\httpd.conf, modify the line that
says, "Listen 80" to Listen \[portNumber\]. E.g.:

    Listen 8080

**You can change the listening port of the pre-installed Apache
server.** In finder, go to "/etc" (CMD+SHIFT+G); from here you will be
able to navigate through the normally hidden Apache files. Find the
folder labeled Apache2, and edit the "http.conf" file. Modify the line
that says, "Listen 80" to Listen \[portNumber\]. E.g.:

    Listen 8080

*Note: If you choose to change the port of the pre-installed Apache
server, you may need to restart your computer for changes to take
effect. You will also have to authenticate as an administrator to change
these files.*

### Test XAMPP Installation

Once XAMPP is installed and you have started the Apache service with the
XAMPP Control Panel tool, you can test it by opening your browser and
navigating to `http://localhost`. You should see the XAMPP welcome screen 
similar to the one below.

![The xampp start page](../../../en/images/hosting/local-hosting-xampp.png)

Select the link called `phpinfo()` in the top menu. This will display a
long screen of information about the PHP configuration, as shown below.

![The xampp php version information page](../../../en/images/hosting/local-hosting-xampp-php.png)

At this point XAMPP is installed successfully. Notice the *Loaded
Configuration File*. We will be editing this file in the next section to
configure XDebug.
