## About This List

This list was originally entitle *Top 10 Stupidest Administrator Tricks*. It
appeared late one night in 2006 in a Forum post
after one developer ended a particularly long round of crack recovery. The post
struck many a nerve among Joomlaists far and wide, and has been translated into
several languages. Some nerves were near the funny bone, others painfully far
from it. Your experience may vary.

**10. Use the cheapest hosting provider you can find.**

Preferably use a shared server that hosts hundreds of other sites, some
of which are high-traffic porn sites. Don't check the list of recommended
hosting providers.

> FYI: You can use a tool such as Robtex (if you are using a shared
> Hosting Provider) to see who you are sharing space with and if you
> should be proactive to request a move to another shared space. For
> example see this Robtex report on joomla.org,
> or for REALLY cool information this Robtex report on google.com.
> The report shows domain, shared, whois, blacklist, analysis, contact...

**9. Don't waste time with regular backups.**

Maybe the hosting provider will help you out.

**8. Don't waste time adjusting PHP and Joomla! settings for increased
security.**

Hey, the install was brain-dead easy. How bad could the rest be? Worry
about those details only if there's a problem.

**7. Use the same username and password for everything.**

Use the same username and password for your on-line bank account,
Joomla! administrator account, Amazon account, Yahoo account, etc. Hey,
who has time to keep track of so many passwords? And anyway, since you
don't change passwords, it's easier to just use the same one all the
time, everywhere.

**6. Install your brand new beautiful Joomla!-powered site, and
celebrate a job well done.**

Don't worry about it again. After all, if you don't make any more
changes, what can go wrong?

**5. Do all upgrades on the live site right away.**

Who needs a development and testing server anyway? If an installation
fails, you'll just uninstall it again. That will hopefully also undo any
damage the installation caused.

**4. Trust third-party extensions.**

Install all the cool-looking stuff you can find. Anyone smart enough to
write a Joomla! extension will provide perfect code that blocks every
known exploit attempt, now and forever. After all, almost all this stuff
is provided for free by well-meaning, good-hearted people who know what
they are doing.

**3. Don't worry about updating to the latest version of Joomla!**

Hey, nothing has gone wrong so far, and if it ain't broke don't fix it!
Same plan for the third-party extensions. Too much work; life's a beach.

**2. When your site gets cracked, panic your way into the Joomla!
Forums.**

Start a new post with a very familiar title ***My Site's Been Hacked!***
Be sure not to leave relevant information, such as which obsolete
versions of Joomla! and third party extensions you have installed.

**1. Once your site's been cracked, fix the defaced *index.php* file and
assume all else is well.**

Don't check raw logs, change your passwords, remove the entire directory
and rebuild from clean backups or take any other overly paranoid-seeming
action. When the attackers return the next day, scream loudly that
you've been ***hacked again*** and it's all Joomla!'s fault. Ignore the
fact that removing a defaced file is not even step one in the difficult
process of fully recovering a cracked site.
