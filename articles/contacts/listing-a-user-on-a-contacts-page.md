## Adding Contacts to a Contact Page

From the Administrator menu select **Components → Contacts → Categories**.

By default, Joomla shows a category called *Uncategorised*. To create a new
category, click on the *New* button. An editing page will open. Name the
category in the title field. The alias field is used in links and should not
include any spaces. If left blank the alias will be created from the Title.
Select *Published* in the Status field. Add an optional image, align it right
or left, and even add a description to indicate what this category of contacts
is for. It will only show up for Backend users. Click *Save* and you have
created a category for your new users.

## Create a New Contact

From the Administrator menu:
* Select **Components → Contacts → Contacts**.
* Select the **New** button in the Toolbar.
* Fill out the data entry form.
* Only the Title is **required**.

You can select an existing registered user but you do not have to. You can add
unregistered users. However, you should comply with local privacy regulations
whether your contacts are registered or not.

You can select an existing Category or begin typing to find a Category if
your list of categories is long.

Enter as much or as little data as necessary and select **Save & Close**.

Click on *New*. This will open an editing window where you can add the
contact name, alias for the computer, and the rest of the left side of
the window is your custom information.

In the Display tab there us an option for vCard. This is a handy digital
business card that will allow visitors to download a preformatted vCard of
the contact. You can find out more about vCards at

## Create a Menu Item

From the Administrator menu:
* Select **Menus → Main Menu** or whichever menu you wish to use.
* Select the **New** button in the Toolbar.
* In the Menus: New Item form enter a Title, for example *Friends*.
* From the Menu Item Type field **Select / Contacts / List Contacts in a Category**.
* From the Select a Category field **Select** and select for example *Friends*.
* Select **Save & Close** as all of the other fields are optional.

Go to your Site frontend and select the menu item just created. You will see
a list of contacts. Select a contact name to see a page containing a contact
form that allows you to send an email. Try it out!

## Restrict access to the Menu Item

Clearly, it is not a good idea to allow anyone to use your Contact form to
send email to that individual. So go back to the menu item and set **Access**
to **Super Users**.
