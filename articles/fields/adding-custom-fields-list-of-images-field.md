<!-- Filename: J3.x:Adding_custom_fields/List_of_Images_Field / Display title: List of Images Field -->

## Purpose

The List of Images Field provides a drop down list of image files to select
for display in the Article output in a space separated list.

## Field Creation

Special options within this field are:

- **Directory** The filesystem path to the directory containing the image
files to be listed. Only images from a single directory can be selected.
- **Multiple** Allow multiple values to be selected.
- **ImageÌ  Class** The class to be added to the image. For example *w-25 p-1*
limits the width of each image to 25% of its container and adds 1 padding
unit.

**Note:** In this example, inclusion of the field type in the Title is for
demonstration purposes only. Leave it out in your own field titles.

## Data Entry

Simple: select one or more images from the list.
