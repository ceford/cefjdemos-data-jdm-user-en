<!-- Filename: J3.x:Adding_custom_fields/Radio_Field / Display title: Radio Field -->

## Purpose

The Radio Field provides radio buttons only one of which may be selected.

## Field Creation

* The **Label** is based on the Title and appears in the output before the
selected value.
* Radio buttons are added one at a time, each with Text and Value. The Text
appears in the output. The value is used in the data entry form and each must
be different. The first item in the list should have the Text set to
*- Select -* and its Value left empty. This allows for the field to be unset
and so not appear in the output.
* Use the drag icons to change the radio button list order.

**Note:** In this example, inclusion of the field type in the Title is for
demonstration purposes only. Leave it out in your own field titles.

## Data Entry

Simple: just select the required value.

## Data Display

The following Site screenshot shows the field displayed in an article. The
option *Automatic display* is responsible for the position of the field and
your template is responsible for the design of the field.

The field Title is followed by the Text of the selected value.
