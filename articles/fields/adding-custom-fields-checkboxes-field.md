<!-- Filename: J3.x:Adding_custom_fields/Checkboxes_Field / Display title: Checkboxes Field -->

## Purpose

The checkboxes field provides one or more checkboxes to be selected in an
article. Boxes that are checked appear in the output as a comma separated list.
In the example that follows checkboxes are used to indicate methods of plant
propogation, which may be one or more of Seed, Cutting or Graft.

## Field Creation

* The **Label** is based on the Title and appears in the output before the
list of selected values
* Checkboxes are added one at a time, each with Text and Value. The Text
appears in the output. The value is used in the data entry form and each must
be different.

**Note:** In this example, inclusion of the field type in the Title is for
demonstration purposes only. Leave it out in your own field titles.

## Data Entry

This is just a matter of selecting the items that should appear in the output.

Fields only appear in an article if populated in the article data entry form.

## Data Display

The following Site screenshot shows the field displayed in an article. The
option *Automatic display* is responsible for the position of the field and
your template is responsible for the design of the field.
