<!-- Filename: J3.x:Adding_custom_fields/User_Field / Display title: User Field -->

## Purpose

The User Field allows selection of a user from a list of users.

## Field Creation

Special options within this field are:

- **Default User** It may useful to set a default user if the same user
appears in almost all of the Articles.

## Date Entry

Simple, just select a user from the list of users.

## Data Display

The following Site screenshot shows the field displayed in an article. The
option *Automatic display* is responsible for the position of the field and
your template is responsible for the design of the field.

Look for the **Reporter** item.
