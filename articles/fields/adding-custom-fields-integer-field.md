<!-- Filename: J3.x:Adding_custom_fields/Integer_Field / Display title: Integer Field -->

## Purpose

The Integer field provides a drop down list of integers between specified
minimum and maximum values.

## Field Creation

Special options for this field:

- **Multiple** Allow multiple values to be selected.
- **First** The lowest in the list.
- **Last** The highest in the list.
- **Step** The increment for each step in the list.
- **Field Class** Set to *w-auto* to make the list just wide enough for its
list of integers.

## Data Entry

Select the required integer from the list, or more than one from a multiple
select list. Notice that without w-auto the integer select field is the full
width of the form.
