## Purpose

The Text Field allows single line text data entry.

## Field Creation

Special options within this field are:

- **Filter** Allow the system to save certain html tags or raw data. Use the
raw filter to ensure that html code is preserved when the form is processed.
- **Maximum Length** The maximum number of characters that can be entered.
- **Prefix** This appears before the text in the Article output. Example: £.
- **Suffix** This appears after the text in the Article output, Example: EUR.

## Data Entry

Simple: Type in your text.

## Data Display

The following Site screenshot shows the field displayed in an article. The
option *Automatic display* is responsible for the position of the field and
your template is responsible for the design of the field.

Look for the **Price** item.
