<!-- Filename: J5.x:Schema_org/Type_JobPosting_-_Using_JobPosting_Plugin / Display title: Schema.org - JobPosting -->

## Purpose

The JobPosting schema type helps search engines better understand and display job information. See the Schema Org [JobPosting type](https://schema.org/JobPosting) for more information.

The schema provides search engines with information such as:

- Job Title
- Job Description
- Identifier - NOTE: assistance needed with defining this set of fields
- Job Posting Date
- Valid Through - how long the job will be open for hiring
- Job Location Description - indicate whether telecommute (remote/work from home), in-person or hybrid
    - If job location is telecommute and there is a country requirement, a textbox appears to enter the country 
- Employment Type - indicate whether part-time, full-time, contract, temp-to-hire, etc.
- Date to Start - indicate when the applicant is expected to start. Use Text to input 'ASAP' or Date to set a specific date.
- Hiring Organization - the person or organization the job posting is for including the name, web address, logo, contact email address, and physical address
- Job Location - the physical location of a job that is not remote or telecommute
- Base Salary - the salary details including the currency, salary range or value and pay frequency
    - Annual Salary example: $60,000 to $80,000 salary range paid annually
    - Hourly Salary example: $21 / hour position

Open an article edit form and select the Schema tab to select a Schema type and set the data for that type. If a Schema Type is not present in the list its Plugin may be disabled. The values to be entered in each field are mostly self-evident.

The *Generic Field* section allows *Title* and *Value* pairs to be entered in addition to the default fields.
