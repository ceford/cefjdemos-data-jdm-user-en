<!-- Filename: Localhost / Display title: Schema.org - Person -->

## Purpose

The Person schema type helps search engines better understand and display Person information. See the Schema Org [Person type](https://schema.org/Person) for more information.

The schema provides search engines with information such as:

- Name
- URL
- Email
- Address
    - Locality
    - Postal Code
    - Street Address

Open an article edit form and select the Schema tab to select a Schema type and set the data for that type. If a Schema Type is not present in the list its Plugin may be disabled. The values to be entered in each field are mostly self-evident.

The *Generic Field* section allows *Title* and *Value* pairs to be entered in addition to the default fields.

## Example Screenshot
