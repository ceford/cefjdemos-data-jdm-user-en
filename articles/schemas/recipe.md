<!-- Filename: J5.x:Schema_org/Type_Recipe_-_Using_Recipe_Plugin / Display title: Schema.org - Recipe -->

## Purpose

The Recipe schema type helps search engines better understand and display recipe information. See the Schema Org [Recipe type](https://schema.org/Recipe) for more information.

The schema provides search engines with information such as:

- Recipe Image
- Recipe Title/Name
- Recipe Author
- Recipe Cook Time
- Published Date
- Short Description
- Cooking Method - for example frying, steaming, baking, etc.
- Recipe Preparation Time
- Category
- Cuisine
- Instructions
- Yield - how much is created with the recipe
- Suitable for Diet - if the recipe is good for certain diet restrictions, such as low-carb, keto, dairy-free, etc.
- Ingredients - a repeatable custom field to enter each ingredient
- Nutrition - a number of columns to enter information about the recipe

Open an article edit form and select the Schema tab to select a Schema type and set the data for that type. If a Schema Type is not present in the list its Plugin may be disabled. The values to be entered in each field are mostly self-evident.

The *Generic Field* section allows *Title* and *Value* pairs to be entered in addition to the default fields.
