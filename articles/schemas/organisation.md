<!-- Filename: J5.x:Schema_org / Display title: Schema.org - Organization -->

## Purpose

The **Organization** schema type is for schools, NGOs, corporations, clubs and similar groups. It is used to help search engines better understand the organization and display business information.  

It provides search engines with information such as:

- Company Name
- Company Physical Address

Open an article edit form and select the Schema tab to select a Schema type and set the data for that type. If a Schema Type is not present in the list its Plugin may be disabled. The values to be entered in each field are mostly self-evident.

The *Generic Field* section allows *Title* and *Value* pairs to be entered in addition to the default fields.

## Example Screenshot
