## Purpose

The Book schema type helps search engines better understand a book and display book information. It is also good for book review sites where the BookReview schema is not available. See the Schema Org [Book type](https://schema.org/Book) for more information.

The schema provides search engines with information such as:

- Title 
- Author
- Date Published
- Abridged/Unabridged
- Edition
- Format (audiobook, e-book, graphic novel, hardback, or paperback)
- Illustrator (all their details)
- ISBN, the International Standard Book Number, uniquely assigned to commercial books
    -Enter the ISBN-13 number, if only the ISBN-10 is available convert to ISBN-13
- Number of pages

Open an article edit form and select the Schema tab to select a Schema type and set the data for that type. If a Schema Type is not present in the list its Plugin may be disabled. The values to be entered in each field are mostly self-evident.

The *Generic Field* section allows *Title* and *Value* pairs to be entered in addition to the default fields.
