<!-- Filename: J5.x:Schema_org/Type_Event_-_Using_Event_Plugin / Display title: Schema.org - Event -->

## Purpose

The Event schema type helps search engines better understand event information. See the Schema Org [Event type](https://schema.org/Event) for more information.

The schema provides search engines with information such as:

- Image for the event
- Event Name
- Event Summary/Hook/Description
- Event Start Date
- Event Location Details
- Event Organizer Details - the type is either an organization or a person who is not organizing on behalf of an organization

Open an article edit form and select the Schema tab to select a Schema type and set the data for that type. If a Schema Type is not present in the list its Plugin may be disabled. The values to be entered in each field are mostly self-evident.

The *Generic Field* section allows *Title* and *Value* pairs to be entered in addition to the default fields.

## Example Screenshot

Below is an example of an Event schema in an Article edit form.
