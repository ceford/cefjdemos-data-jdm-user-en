## Purpose

The Article schema type helps search engines better understand and display an article. See the Schema Org [Article type](https://schema.org/Article) for more information.

The schema provides search engines with information such as:

- Image
- Headline
- Description
- Author
    - Type
    - Name
    - URL
    - Email
    - Address
        - Locality
        - Postal Code
        - Street Address
- Date Published
- Date Modified

Open an article edit form and select the Schema tab to select a Schema type and set the data for that type. If a Schema Type is not present in the list its Plugin may be disabled. The values to be entered in each field are mostly self-evident.

The *Generic Field* section allows *Title* and *Value* pairs to be entered in addition to the default fields.
