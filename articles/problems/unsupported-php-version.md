### Updating your PHP Version

There are several ways to update your PHP version. The main ones are
covered in an article in the September 2020 issue of Joomla Community
Magazine: <a

update my PHP version?</a>.

If you are using CPanel or Plesk there should be an option to upgrade php
in your dashboard. If there is no option or you are unsure about how to
achieve this contact your host. Using modern PHP Versions is essential
for keeping your site secure. If your host does not offer a version above
7.2.5 then you may want to consider alternative hosting!

If you're developing locally then you need to download an updated
version of the local hosting tool you are using, for example
XAMPP
