## Introduction

Suppose one of your articles is sufficiently important for it to merit a
menu item - a link to it from the Main Menu. That would be a *Single Article*
menu item type. There are several ways to create a new menu item:

- In the Administrator menu, expand the Menus item and select the **+**
  icon beside the *Main Menu* item.
- Select **Main Menu** in the Administrator menu and then select the
  **New** button in the Toolbar.
- Select **All Menu Items** in the Administrator menu and then select
  the **New** button in the Toolbar. If you use this route you also need
  to select the Menu the new item will appear in.

## The Menu Edit Page

The *Menus: New Item* form has four compulsory fields to complete:

- **Menu Title** Enter a meaningful word or short phrase that will fit
  nicely into the Main Menu box.
- **Menu Item Type** Select to open a **Menu Item Type** modal dialog.
  - open the **Articles** list and select the *Single Article* type.
- **Select Article** Another modal dialog with a list of Articles. 
  - Find and select the article this menu item will link to.
- **Menu** Over on the right (or below on small screens) check that a
  menu is selected.
- Select **Save & Close** in the Toolbar button.

That is all that must be done. Everything else is optional. Have a look at the 
site Home page. The menu item in the Main menu links directly to that page.

## Multiple Menu Items

So far so good. But what happens when you have 10 or 100 or 1000 or more
articles? It is time to think of other ways of managing articles and
other page layouts.

## Create a Category List Menu Item

- Select the **Menus → Main Menu → +** icon from the Administrator menu to open 
  the *Menus: New Item* edit form.
- Select **Articles → Category List** in the *Menu Item Type* field.
- Select **Select → Mammals** in the *Choose a Category* field.
- Enter a **Title**, perhaps *Articles about Mammals* to make it clear this menu 
  item is expected to show a list of articles.
- **Save and Close**.

Go to the Site Home page and reload. Select the new *Articles about Mammals* menu
item.

Select the article title, Mammals, to go to the article view. If you have many
articles you can find them here so do not need single article menu items.
