<!-- Filename: J4.x:Getting_Started:_Adding_an_Article / Display title: Adding an Article -->

## Introduction

After login, starting from the Home Dashboard, there are several ways to create
a new article:

- Select the **+** icon adjacent to the *Articles* button in the Home Dashboard 
  *Site* panel.
- Expand the *Content* menu and select the **+** button adjacent to
  *Articles* there.
- In either location, select the **Articles** item and in the Articles
  list page select the **New** button the Toolbar.

Until an article has been created the Articles page shows a placeholder page
saying *No Articles have been created yet.*

## The Toolbar

On almost every page, immediately beneath the title bar, is a bar
containing action buttons. This is known as the Toolbar. The buttons
differ from page to page and sometimes are inactive, appearing grey,
until an item is selected in the list of items. The following screenshot shows
the *Articles* list with an article checkbox selected. The *Action* button is a 
drop-down list that has been selected to show the options available.

Select the *New* button in the *Articles* page *Toolbar* to open an article
edit form. 

## The Articles: Edit page

Until an article has been saved the *Title bar* label is *Articles: New* and it 
has few Toolbar buttons. The *Cancel* button can be used to cancel creation of 
an article. There is no warning message. Any content entered is discarded. 
After saving, the Title bar label is *Articles: Edit* and the Toolbar has many 
more buttons.

There are a bewildering number of form fields in the Edit page but all
except two have sensible defaults. The fields to fill in:

- **Title** This is **required** and should be something short and
  simple. In Joomla, any form item marked as required must be filled in
  or the form contents cannot be saved. You could use *My First Article* to get
  started. In the following examples the word *Article* followed by language 
  code was used for demonstration purposes in several different languages.
- **Content** The article text. This is optional but it would not make
  much sense to have an article with no content. So start typing. If you
  just want something to try out copy the following paragraph:

  >Lorem ipsum ad his scripta blandit partiendo, eum fastidii accumsan euripidis in, eum liber hendrerit an. Qui ut wisi vocibus suscipiantur, quo dicit ridens inciderint id. Quo mundi lobortis reformidans eu, legimus senseritdefiniebas an eos. Eu sit tincidunt incorrupte definitionem, vis mutat affert percipit cu, eirmod consectetuer signiferumque eu per. In usu latineequidem dolores. Quo no falli viris intellegam, ut fugit veritus placeratper. Ius id vidit volumus mandamus, vide veritus democritum te nec, ei eosdebet libris consulatu.
- **Featured** To the right of the edit box (on laptop or larger
  screens and below on smaller screens) there is a field to select to
  make this a *Featured* article. Select it and then select the **Save**
  button in the Toolbar. Featured articles may be given priority in site
  layouts and several may appear together in a *Featured* blog layout.

## Preview

To see what it looks like you can select the *Preview* button in the Toolbar.

Note the article metadata: the information between the Title and the
Content. You can configure what information appears and where it appears
with those other article form fields. Later...

## The Read More Break

If your article is several paragraphs long and you wish to show a number
of featured articles on the Home page of your website, you should insert
a *Read More...* break after the first paragraph. If you select the Editor 
*CMS Content* button you will find it at the bottom of the list. The break
appears as a horizontal dashed red line. Here is another paragraph of
test text to insert below the page break:

>Donec sodales sagittis magna. Sed consequat, leo eget bibendum sodales,
augue velit cursus nunc, quis gravida magna mi a libero. Fusce vulputate
eleifend sapien. Vestibulum purus quam, scelerisque ut, mollis sed,
nonummy id, metus. Nullam accumsan lorem in dui. Cras ultricies mi eu
turpis hendrerit fringilla. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus
orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae; In ac dui quis mi
consectetuer lacinia. Nam pretium turpis et arcu. Duis arcu tortor,
suscipit eget, imperdiet nec, imperdiet iaculis, ipsum. Sed aliquam
ultrices mauris. Integer ante arcu, accumsan a, consectetuer eget,
posuere ut, mauris.

The result is that only the text before the page break appears on a 
Category Blog or Featured Articles page (the Home page). Select the 
Article Title or the Read More button to see the full article on its own.

- Select **Save & Close** to close the edit form and go back to the *Articles* 
  list page.

A new Joomla installation has a Site menu with a single menu item labelled 
*Home*. It uses a *Featured Articles* blog layout. Select the *Site name* link 
at the top right of the Joomla Administrator page to open a new tab showing
the site Home page with your new article.

## Site View

The following screenshot shows a site view of the first part of the article 
described above. Your new Joomla! site will have just the *Main Menu*, 
*Login Form* and your article. This screenshot is for a multi-lingual site
that shows the same page in many different languages and has other content
used in later tutorials.

### Breadcrumbs

The pale grey line that says *You are here: Home* is a configurable module 
showing where you are in the category tree.
