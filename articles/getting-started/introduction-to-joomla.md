## Introduction

Joomla! is one of the most popular, free and open-source content
management systems (CMS) available for publishing web content. It is
user friendly, extendable, multilingual, accessible, responsive, search
engine optimised and so much more.

There are thousands of free and commercial Joomla! Extensions available
from third parties for all sorts of special purposes. However, Joomla!
comes with enough **core** Extensions to allow you to create a fully
functional website out of the box in a few minutes. It is best to
familiarise yourself with the core Joomla capabilities before looking
for third party Extensions.

Joomla! must be installed on a web server, either on a hosting service
to make your content available to the rest of the world or on your own
laptop or desktop computer for private testing purposes.

## Joomla! Architecture

A Joomla! installation consists of the files used to manage and display
content and a database where most of the content is stored. There are
separate interfaces for the public Site and for the site Administrator,
although many administrator functions can be accomplished with the site
interface. The interface appearance is generated by a set of files
collectively known as a template.

### Site Template - Cassiopeia

This template has all you need to get started with your own website. It
can be customised with template settings and user specified features
such as images and colours.

If Cassiopeia is not quite right for your site, there are hundreds of
other templates available from third party suppliers, both free and
commercial.

#### Cassiopeia Features to notice

- The top blue bar is the *Header*, typically containing a Logo and a
  Company name. You can add an image to use as a logo and change
  Cassiopeia to whatever you want.
- The boxes to the right labeled *Main Menu* and *Login Form* are
  examples of modules. The grey bar containing *You are here:* is a
  *Breadcrumb* module. It shows where you are in a page tree, useful in
  complex sites.
- The main area of the page is where the content appears. In a new installation 
  it may be empty but in an established site it typically contains a single
  article or a *Blog* layout containing tasters for several recent articles.

### Administrator Template - Atum

This template is not seen by the public so it is rarely necessary to
seek an alternative.

You can configure what appears on various dashboards but that is best
left until experience warrants a change.

#### Atum Features to notice

- At the top is the Title bar containing the Joomla Logo, the Title of
  the page on display and a group of Information icons. They are on
  every page except *Edit* pages. To find out what they do: try them.
- The default page is the *Home Dashboard*. It contains panels grouping
  together often used Management features. You can add and remove panels
  as you please. And you can add items to panels and remove items too.
- The column to the left is the *Administrator Menu*. This provides
  access to the most commonly used features. The right bracket marker
  (\>) indicates that this menu opens to reveal more items. The group of
  four squares marker opens a dashboard that also contains panels
  grouping together commonly used features.
- The Toggle button collapses or expands the menu on demand to provide
  more workspace.

## Extensions

Joomla! code consists of several different types of Extension:

- **Components** control what appears in the main part of each page.
  Examples include the Content Component for articles and the Smart
  Search Component for search results.
- **Modules** contain code to manage the boxes that appear at the top,
  left, right or bottom of a page. Examples include a Login Module, a
  Menu Module and a Footer Module.
- **Plugins** add functionality to the site. Examples include
  Authentication options, Captcha options and Editor choices.
- **Templates** display page output to your specifications.
- **Languages** allow you to choose one or more languages in which to
  display and/or manage your content.
- **Libraries** are something for developers only.

Joomla! has all the core Extensions you need for most types of personal
and community websites. You only need to look for third party Extensions
for more complex requirements such as sales and marketing.
