## Introduction

Mail Templates are used to send system email messages in **plain text** or **HTML** or both, selected in the *Mail Templates: Options* form. If only one method is selected the alternative will not be present in the message edit form. 

The following screenshot shows a selection of the 26 standard Mail Templates available. The list is available by selecting **System -> Mail Templates** from the Administrator menu,

The mail messages can be customised to alter layout, appearance and wording to suit your siteâ€™s needs. For example, you might like to use a site logo and colour scheme in those emails sent to customers. Customisation of emails sent to administrators is less important. 

There are two customisation methods: via the *Mail Template: Options* for all mail templates and via *Per Template Mail Settings*.

## Mail Template: Options

Select the **Options** button in the *Mail Templates* list Toolbar to gain access to the overall mail template settings. Select the *Toggle Inline Help* button to see if any of the form fields have extra help.

### Mail Format

Be aware that a recipient may set a mail client to use simple HTML or Plain Text to avoid download of images. So it may be best to set the *Mail Format* to *Plaintext* or *Both*.

### Per Template Mail Settings

If this is set to **Yes** then individual mail template edit forms have an extra *Options* tab that let you change mail settings for that template and optionally allow you to send a copy (BCC) to a specific email address provided that the **Send Copy** field here is also set to **Enabled**.

## Template Edit Form

In the list of Mail Templates you can select any template to edit. The Title link leads to the edit form for the default English template. Each flag is a link to the same template in that language.

### The Mail tab

![edit mail template form](../../../en/images/templates/mail-template-edit.png)

The contents of the Subject and Body areas are stored in language strings initially. This makes it easy to *Reset To Default Subject* or *Body*. However, once a specific mail template has been edited its Subject and Body fields are stored in the `#__mail_templates` table. 

The items in curly braces are placeholder tags that are replaced by real values when the email is sent. In the example above `{SITENAME}` would be whatever name you chose for your site. `{Method}` would be the selected mail transport method: `PHP Mail`, `Sendmail` or `SMTP`.

The placeholder tags available vary from mail to mail. You could add your own custom placeholder tags but that requires a custom plugin, described in a [Magazine article](https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/february-2025/joomla-5-email-templates-how-to-add-variables-via-plugin) from February 2025.

### The Options tab

This tab is only present if the *Per Template Mail Settings* is set to *Yes* in *Mail Templates: Options*. The illustration below shows a screenshot with *Mail Settings* set to *No*. If set to *Yes* more form fields appear that override the Mail options set in the Global Configuration, Server tab.

If you want to send a blind carbon copy of an outgoing email to a specific email address you can enter it in the *Send Copy To Email* field.

## Mail Template Overrides

To create a mail template override within a custom template:

1. Go to System -> Site Templates -> Open your template (e.g., Cassiopeia).
2. In the Create Overrides tab, select joomla -> mail.
3. Joomla will copy the `mailtemplate.php` file to your template's `/html/layouts/joomla/mail/` directory, where you can modify it as needed.

Once the override is created, you can adjust the layout and styles of your emails without affecting the base template.
