## Introduction

Cassiopeia is the site template supplied with Joomla 4. It is an
excellent general purpose **accessible** and **responsive** template. It
can be customised via the template options and the *user.css* file by
users with a little knowledge of HTML and CSS.

The following illustration shows the appearance of a Joomla 4 site with
one article and a few menu items created.

![Cassiopeia single article view](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-article-view.png)

## Templates: Edit Style

You can experiment with the site appearance by opening the Edit Style
form. Go to **System → Templates → Site Template Styles** and
select the template title in the Style column, Cassiopeia - Default. The
Advanced tab contains settings you can adjust:

![Cassiopeia edit style advanced tab](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-edit-style.png)

To try the options have one browser tab or window open with the
Administrator interface and a second tab or window with the Site
interface and switch back and forth after each saved change.

### Brand

- **Yes** the default. The Cassiopeia logo bar containing a Logo or
  Brand name is displayed with a dark background, blue by default.
- **No** The logo bar is not displayed. The options to select a Logo,
  Title and Tagline disappear.

The default brand image is the word Cassiopeia as an image in an SVG
file. That is what is displayed in the first illustration above.

You might set the Brand to No if you wish to provide branding in a
custom HTML module.

### Logo

- **None** The default Cassiopeia image logo will be used unless a Title
  is defined.
- **Logo Image** The selected Logo will appear in place of the
  Cassiopeia logo even if a Title is defined.

### Title (alternative to logo)

- **My Brand Name** If present and you have not selected a Logo image,
  the words in the Title field will appear but underlined in the blue
  top bar.

### Tag Line

- **Always at your service** If present the words in the tag-line field
  will appear in a small font size beneath the logo image or Brand name.

![Cassiopeia brand with tagline](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-brand-with-tagline.png)

### Fonts Scheme

- **None** the default. The font family specified in the template style
  sheet is used, which usually means the site will use the fonts you are
  familiar with available on your own computer.
- **Others** A font family located in the template folder hierarchy or
  downloaded from the web will be used. You can see the changed
  appearance of the text on a page when you reload the site after
  changing this option.

### Color Theme

- **Standard** A dark blue background color for the Brand bar and other
  features such as the Login button.
- **Alternative** A maroon background color instead of dark blue.

![Cassiopeia alternative colour scheme](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-alt-color-scheme.png)

### Layout

- **Static** the default. The maximum width is set to 1320px. On wider
  screens the margin just gets wider.
- **Fluid** There is no maximum width.

The view on a narrow screen mobile device:

![Cassiopeia mobile view](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-mobile-view.png)

### Sticky Header

- **No** the default. Header items and content scroll upwards out of the
  viewport.
- **Yes** Except on narrow screens, header items remain fixed to the top
  of the viewport while the content items scroll upwards. That is only
  evident where page content is taller than the viewport.

### Back-to-top Link

- **No** the default. There is no Back-to-top link.
- **Yes** Where content is taller than the viewport, at the bottom right
  of the page is a button marked with an Up chevron. Select it to scroll
  back to the top of the page.

## Cassiopeia Template Positions

As you build a site with Cassiopeia it becomes really useful to know the
locations of the positions you can use for modules. Some are
descriptive, like *menu* and *bottom-a* but it is not so obvious where
they are until you use them. This illustration should help:

![Cassiopeia template positions](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-template-positions.png)

Try the following:

### Move the Menu Module to the *menu* Position

A newly installed Joomla 4 site has a menu in the *sidebar-right*
position, seen in the first illustration above. For this tutorial some
menu items have been added, one of which is a parent with two child
items. To move this menu to the menu position go to **Content **→** Site
Modules** in the Administrator menu. In the list there are three modules
including Main Menu. Select it to open the Modules: Menu edit form.

In the Module tab, change the Position field at the right to Menu
\[menu\]. Save and have a look at the result in the Site display. The
menu looks fine but the child items are not there.

In the menu edit form select the Advanced tab and scroll down to the
Layout field. It is a drop-down list with four options. --From Module--
/ Default is selected by default. Try the other options and view the
result. (Remember to *Save* in the edit form and reload in the Site
view.) Neither of the --From Module-- options show the child menu items
but both of the --From Cassiopeia Template-- do.

![Cassiopeia menu positions](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-menu-position.png)

So what difference does **Collapsible** make?

- Collapsible Dropdown: On narrow screen mobile devices the menu
  collapses to a Hamburger icon until selected. On selection it expands
  to show a vertical list.
- Dropdown: The menu always appears as a vertical list.

### Move the Menu Module to the *topbar* Position

In the edit form Module tab set the Position to Top Bar \[topbar\] and
have a look at the result. There is a snag - the menu is positioned
further to the left than when it was in the menu position. That is
because menu position and logo location have a CSS class of *grid-child*
but the topbar does not. That can be fixed with an entry in the
*user.css* file, coming below.

## Customise Cassiopeia

What if you do not care for the dark blue header background colour?
Suppose you would prefer a dark green theme. To fix that you need a
little knowledge of CSS. Go to **System **→** Site
Templates **→** Cassiopeia Details and Files** to open the Template:
Customise (Cassiopeia) form.

The illustration below shows two folder groups. The first group consists
of the template folders and files that you should not change but you may
add to. In particular you may add template override HTML files to the
*html* folder, The second group contains the template media files that
you should not change. However, you may add a *user.css* file to the
*css* folder and/or a *user.js* file to the *js* folder. You would do
this if you wanted to make a few simple changes to site appearance.

![Cassiopeia edit files](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-edit-files.png)

Note that there is no *user.css* file present in the *css* folder. That
is one you create yourself so that you can override previously defined
styles. If it is not present, create it now by selecting the the *css*
folder and then the *New* button. In the New File modal dialog select
the *css* folder otherwise the new file will appear in the wrong place.
Enter user (lower case and without *.css*) in the File Name field and
select *.css* from the File Type field. Select the Create button to
create the file. If *user.css* is already present, select it to open the
edit form.

### Headings

As a simple starter, change the colour of headings to dark green.
Headings are tags in the range *h1, h2, h3, h4, h5* and *h6*. In the
*user.css* file enter the style definition:
```css
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      color: darkgreen;
    }
```
Save and reload the site to see the result. The Page or Article title
should be dark green. If not, check what you have typed. The formal
language for Joomla documentation is British English, so colour rather
than color as in American English. But in CSS it must be color. Is the
punctuation correct?

Not so obvious is that some tags other than headings may be styled to
look like headings. So add this:
```css
    .h1, .h2, .h3, .h4, .h5, .h6 {
      color: darkgreen;
    }
```
Note here that the leading dot (.) is a class selector, for example
Dummy H1 - so there is a dot in the CSS file but not in the class name.

### Header Background

In the browser tab containing the Site, open your browser Developer
Tools, Firefox in this example, and select the header tag.

![Cassiopeia developer tools](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-developer-tools.png)

That shows the styles used. The container-header style is where the
background-color and background-image are set. They need to overriden in
the *user.css* file. Try this:
```css
    .container-header {
      background-color: darkgreen;
      background-image: none;
    }
```
### *topbar* Style

Remember that comment about the menu being too far to the left in the
topbar? That is because it does not have a maximum width and appropriate
margins set. Put this in *user.css* file to fix that:
```css
    .container-topbar {
      max-width: 1320px;
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
    }
```
This is the working green theme:

![Cassiopeia green theme](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-green-theme.png)

### Accessibility

Note that there must be a sufficient contrast between background and
foreground colours to meet web accessibility standards. You can check
your contrast at the WebAIM Contrast Checker.
Dark green is \#006400.

## Overrides

The Templates: Customise (Cassiopeia) form Create Overrides tab shows
the list of extensions for which you can create an override. Note the
different symbols: select a folder symbol to show a list of the folders
and files it contains; select a multi-file symbol to immediately create
an override for that extension; the created item disappears from the
list - select the Editor tab and locate the created override in the
*html* folder. There may be more than one file created - the created
files are copied from the original extension ready for you to edit. For
that you need to know some HTML and PHP!

This is the Create Overrides tab:

![Cassiopeia create overrides](../../../en/images/templates/cassiopeia-customisation-create-overrides.png)

If you are just experimenting and do not really want an override, you
can *Close* the edit form, Select the Manage Folders button in the
Toolbar and select the Delete button at the bottom of the Manage Folders
modal form.

Overrides are really about customising extensions rather the Cassiopeia
template and that is another story.

## Child Templates

If you want to make more substantial changes to site appearance you
could create a child template. That copies just a small selection of
folders and files for you to change or add to but otherwise continues to
use the parent template folders and files. By using child templates you
could have some pages with one theme colour and other pages with a
second theme colour. Child templates are covered elsewhere. This is an
illustration of the file structure in a child of Cassiopeia:
