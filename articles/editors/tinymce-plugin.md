## Introduction

**TinyMCE** is the default editor for both frontend and backend users.
It is a **WYSIWYG** (What You See Is What You Get) editor that uses a 
word-processor type interface for editing articles and other content. It is not 
quite WYSIWYG because the site view of an article may have styles that are 
not implemented in the editor view.

## Toolbar Sets

TinyMCE is configured with 3 different sets of toolbar buttons for different
user groups. Each default group can be further configured by adding or removing
tools in the TinyMCE plugin edit page.

### Toolset 0

This toolset is the most extended set and is by default assigned to the 
*Administrator*, *Editor* and *Super Users* groups.

### Toolset 2

This set has minimal tools and is assigned to the *Public* group. It would be
used for filling out public forms.

## Other Settings

Following the toolset selectors there is a long list of parameters. All have
suitable default settings for general purposes. Text filters are covered in a 
separate article on [html filters](jdocmanual?article=user/editors/html-filters).
