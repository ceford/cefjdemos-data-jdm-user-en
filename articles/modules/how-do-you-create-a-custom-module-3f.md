<!-- Filename: How_do_you_create_a_custom_module%3F / Display title: Custom Module -->

## Purpose

The Custom module allows you to create Module content using a WYSIWYG editor.
It is great for simple messages, optionally with images.

## Create the Custom module

Use one of the following methods:
* Select the **Modules** item from the Home Dashboard. Or...
* Select the **Content / Site Modules** from the Administrator menu.
* Select the **Custom** item from the Modules (Site) list.

This will create the new module and open the module for configuration.

## Configuring the Module

For standard usage of the module there are just a few settings:

- **Title** Enter a name for the module.
- **Module Content** Type in content as you would for an article.
- **Title Show/Hide** Choose whether or not to show the title by toggling to
*Show* or *hide*.
- **Position** Set a position where you want to display the module on the
front end. Positions are dictated by your template. This example uses Joomla’s
Cassiopeia template *Sidebar Right* position.
- **Status** By default, the module status is **Published**. Other options are
**Unpublished** and **Trashed**.
- **Start Publishing** You can schedule the start of publishing of the
module.
- **Finish Publishing** You can schedule when to stop publishing the
module.
- **Access** If you want to control who can see the module on the
frontend you can choose an access level.
- **Ordering** Used to control where the module displays within the
position you have selected. For example, you may have a number of
modules in the sidebar and want this one to be at the top or bottom – or
somewhere between others in the sidebar. It can be a little confusing at
first as the field shows a numbered position and a module name. The name
can be a module that is unpublished. The thing to remember is that the
lowest number will be at the top and highest number is at the bottom.
- **Note** Can be helpful to use the note field if for example you are
using the same module type in several places.

### Menu Assignment Tab

By default the module will be published **On all pages**.

Alternatively you can choose via a drop down list **No pages**, **Only
on the pages selected** or **On all pages except those selected**. The
last two options provide you with a menu tree of the menus used on the
website where you can select/deselect pages.

### Other

The **Options** tab allows you to set a background image for the module.

The **Advanced** tab has settings related to layout of the module when it is
output.

The **Permissions** tab allows you to control what user groups can do with
the module.

## Publishing the Module

When you are ready, select the **Save & Close** button.

The module will be published in the sidebar of the website and display
whatever text you entered.
