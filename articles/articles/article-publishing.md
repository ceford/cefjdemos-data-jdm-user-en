<!-- Filename:  J6.x:_Article_Publishing / Display title: Article: Edit - Publishing -->

## Introduction

Joomla keeps a variety of date information and other metadata for each
article. The data can be inspected and in some cases altered in the
*Article: Edit* form *Publishing Tab*.

The *Metadata* panel is explained in a separate article. This article covers
the *Publishing* panel.

## Publishing panel

Some of the items in the form are intended for information and cannot be changed
directly in the form. They are shown with grey backgrounds. Other fields can be
change for specific purposes.

### Start Publishing

This field is set to the current date and time when the article is first saved.
If you want the article to be embargoed until a future date and time you can
set its value using the Calendar tool or by directly editing the field values.

### Finish Publishing

By default, this field is blank. If you wish the article to disappear
after a specified date and time use the Calendar tool or type a future date and
time directly into the field. At that point the article will vanish from the
site. In the Articles list it will be marked as *Published, but has Expired*.

### Start Featured

If the article is marked as a *Featured Article*, this field can be set so that 
it appears in a *Featured Articles* layout on the specified date. Note that the
date will not be saved if the article is not marked as a *Featured Article*.

### End Featured

If the article is marked as a Featured Article, this field can be set so that
it disappears from a *Featured Articles* layout on the specified date. The
article remains published and may still appear in other layouts. In the Articles
list it will be marked as *Featured, but has Expired*.

### Created Date

This date is set when the article is first saved. You may wish to change it
if you have created a series of articles in random order and you wish to sort
them into a creation data order.

### Created By

The User Id of the creator is saved at the time of creation and the Name of
that user appears in this field. You can change the Creator by selecting the
person icon to reveal a *Select User* popup dialog from which you can find and
select a different user.

### Created by Alias

If you do not wish the creator Username to appear in the article information 
block you can insert an Alias here. Enter your alias, save the article and 
take a look with the Preview button in the Toolbar.
