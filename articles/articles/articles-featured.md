## Introduction

In Joomla! **Featured Articles** appear in a blog layout well-suited to be a 
Home page. Any article in any category may be selected as a featured item. The 
articles my be arranged using one or more ordering criteria, for example by 
Featured Articles Order or by Most Recent First.

## Choosing Articles to Feature

- Select **Content → Articles** from the Administrator menu to see a
  list of all of your articles.

There is a screenshot of an articles list in the previous article entitled
[Articles: Filter Options](jdocmanual?article=user/articles/articles-filter-options). 
It shows a *Featured* column with some articles having the *Featured* 
icon (a yellow star) and some with the *Unfeatured* icon (a grey bulls-eye). 
The icons are used to toggle the featured status.

You can select multiple articles to feature by selecting row check-boxes and 
using the **Actions → Feature** button in the Toolbar. Also, in the 
*Articles: Edit* page you may toggle the Featured field from *No* to *Yes* 
and vice-versa.

## The Featured Articles page

To see the articles selected for a *Featured Articles* layout:

- Select **Content → Featured Articles** from the Administrator menu.

The following screenshot shows a list of featured articles containing four 
items, enough to create an interesting blog layout.:

### Featured Article Order

The default order of the Articles list in the site view is ID Descending, which 
puts the latest article at the top of the list. There are many options available 
to set the display order. The ordering method may be selected via the 
**Blog Layout** tab of a **Featured Articles** menu item. It may involve 
dragging the articles into a desired order in the Featured Articles
page. Ordering methods will be covered in a separate articles.

### Read More

A blog layout works best if the amount of text in each item is limited
to one or two paragraphs with a link beneath to the full article. A 
*Read More...* link is inserted in the *Article: Edit* form using the 
*CMS Content* / *Read More* button. Again that is covered in a separate
article.
