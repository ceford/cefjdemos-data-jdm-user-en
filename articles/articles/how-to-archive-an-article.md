<!-- Filename: J4.x:How_to_Archive_an_Article / Display title: How to Archive an Article -->

## Introduction

As your website content grows it is likely that some of that content
will need to be updated or replaced. You might choose to unpublish some
articles but you may have a requirement to keep them in a way that people
can still view them.

Joomla! makes archiving of articles a simple process by allowing you to
change the status of the article to **Archived**. A benefit of archiving
is that it makes content management easier and archiving is structured
by year.

This status based approach is a key part of Joomla’s ability to
effectively and efficiently manage content. Once archived, Joomla
provides methods to access and display the content.

## Archiving Articles

You can archive an article in several places, in the **Articles** list, in
the Article itself or in the Article via it’s Menu Item.

### Archiving via the Articles list

Once logged into Joomla go to Articles list via the Home Dashboard or Menu.

alt="navigate to articles list" />

From the Articles list select the checkboxes for the articles you want to
archive. Note that you can archive several articles at once. Selecting one or
more articles will enable the **Actions** dropdown list.

From the **Actions** dropdown list selct **Archive**.

data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="539" width="800" height="431"
alt="archive from articles list" />

The selected articles will no longer appear in the *default* Articles list.

### Archiving Within an Article

When an article is open you can archive it by simply changing the
article's **Status**.

* Select the **Status** dropdown icon.
* Select **Archived**.
* **Save & Close** the article.

### From Within a Menu Item

This method only applies for articles that appear in a menu as a
**Single Article**. With the Menu Item open:

* Select the **Edit** button in the **Select Article** field.
    The article will be opened in a panel.
    * Change the status of the article to **Archived** as shown in the
    previous method above.
    * Select **Save & Close** to close the article edit form.
* Select **Save & Close** to close the menu item edit form.

## Viewing Archived Articles

Once articles have been archived, there are several ways to view them.

### To view from the backend

In the Articles list
* Select the **Filter Options** button
* Select the **Select Status** dropdown.
* Select **Archived**.

This will apply a filter to display all articles set with a status of archived.

data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="283" width="800" height="226"
alt="filter articles list" />

Return to the default article list view by selecting the **Clear** button.

### To view from the frontend via a menu

There is an [Archived Articles](jdocmanual?article=user/menus/menu-item-type-archived-articles "")
menu item type that you can use to create a link in your menu to archived
articles.

### To view from the frontend via a module

There is an  [Articles – Archived](jdocmanual?article=user/modules/articles-archived-module "")
module type that you can use to display in a one of your website template
module positions.

## Un-archive Articles

To un-archive an article the same process applies - the status of the
article is changed from **Archived** to **Published**.

Follow the steps above at **Viewing Archived Articles** to view from
the backend. Filter for archived articles, select the relevant
articles and change status to **Published**.

## Quick Tips

* Remember, archived articles are filtered from view in the Articles
list. You must change the status filter to **Archived** to view them.
* Archiving does not unpublish an article.
* You can also archive articles from the frontend when logged in for
frontend editing.
