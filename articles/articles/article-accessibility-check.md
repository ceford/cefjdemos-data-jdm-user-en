## Introduction

Accessibility is an important topic in web site design. In many countries it
is a legal requirement. Here is one definition of what it means:

>Web accessibility is the design and development of websites and tools so that 
  people with disabilities can use them. It means that people can: 
>- Perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web 
>- Contribute to the web 
>- Do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone without a disability
>
>Accessibility is important because it addresses discriminatory aspects related 
to user experience. For example, slow-loading websites, badly-designed fonts, 
and non-mobile-friendly web pages can be restrictive for people with disabilities.

Joomla has a built-in accessibility checker. It is available from the Toolbar of
the *Article: Edit* page. The *System - Joomla Accessibility Checker* plugin 
must be enabled!

The check tool is operated with the blue circle icon at the bottom right of the
screen. Select it to open or close a report. Select the green tick (or yellow
cross) to look at each element that has been tested.

## Further Information

The accessibility checker tool is fully described in a GitHub article entitled
