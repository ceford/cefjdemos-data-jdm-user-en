## Introduction

Joomla! allows you to add an article to a menu from the article itself. This 
feature provides an efficient way to speed up the process of publishing articles 
by removing the need to close the article and then go to the *Menus: Items* list.

## Edit an Article

- From the **Content → Articles** list select an existing article to edit. Or...
- Select the **New** button in the Toolbar to create a new article.
- Make any required additions or changes to the article.
- Select **Save to Menu** from the *Save & Close* dropdown list. This saves
  the article and opens a new *Menus: New Item* form with the *Menu Item Type* 
  set to *Single Article*. All of the required information is already 
  entered in the form. 
- Verify the *Menu* in the right of the form is set for the intended Menu.
- Select **Save & Close** to go to the **Menus: Items** page for the menu you 
  added the article to. The menu item for the article should be in the list of 
  menu items.
