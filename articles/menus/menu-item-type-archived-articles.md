<!-- Filename: J4.x:How_to_Create_a_Menu_Item_to_View_Archived_Articles / Display title: Archived Articles -->

## Introduction

Over time, article lists can grow to be very long. One way to reduce the
clutter is to archive older articles. This is done by changing an article
**Status** from *Published* to *Archived* in the **Articles** list page. It
can be done simultaneously for multiple articles in the *Actions* dropdown list.

But what if older articles should be made available to website visitors? There
is a menu item type available for that.

## Step by Step

1. Select **Main Menu** or any other site menu in which the link is to appear.
1. Select the **New** button from the *Toolbar* in the *Menus: Items* list.
1. In the *Menus: New Item* data entry form enter a suitable **Title**, for
example *Archived Articles*.
1. In the *Menu Item Type* field select **Articles / Archived Articles** from
the popup dialog box.
1. Change any of the other parameters to suit your requirements. For example,
you could delete **All Categories** and choose one or more categories from
the dropdown list.
1. Select **Save & Close** to create the new menu item.

There are a number of parameters you can change – you can find out more
detailed information in the
[Help](jdocmanual?article=help/menu-items/menu-item-article-archived "Menu Item: Archived Article") screen.

After saving, the new menu item it will appear in the Site menu in the order
added or the order adjusted by drag and drop or in this menu edit form.

## The Archived Articles Page

The *Archived Articles* link leads to a page that displays a list of archived
articles:

This example is the default output. You may choose to alter this so
that, for example, you only show the linked title and the category –
Joomla allows you to easily modify it. You may decide you just want to
show the title but it’s worth experimenting to set it up how you want
it.

You can filter the archived articles by *Month* and *Year* by selecting the
relevant dropdown list items. You can also control the number of results.
Pagination is displayed at the bottom of the page depending on the number of
articles and menu item settings. Select the **Filter** button to apply the
filter.

## Tips

Remember, use the Menu Item **Options** tab to tailor the output to your
needs.

Dependant on your abilities you can further change the look of the
output with the use of custom styles and Template Overrides
(mod_articles_archive).
