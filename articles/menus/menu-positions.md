## Menu Layout

If you move a menu module from a side position to a top position, or
vice-versa, you may wish to change the layout too.

- Default layout, often used for side menus, has all items visible but
  with child items indented.
- Dropdown layout, often used for top menus, has the parent items
  visible with child items available via drop-down lists.
- To change the layout:
  - Select the Advanced tab.
  - From the Layout drop-down list select the appropriate option.
  - Select **Save & Close** from the Toolbar.
- View the site to check the result.
