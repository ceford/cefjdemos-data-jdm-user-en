## Introduction

When selecting media files, such as images within an article or editor, a newly uploaded image is automatically selected. This eliminates the need for manual file selection thus making file management more efficient.

For example:

1. Create a new article.
2. Select the Images and Links tab.
3. Select the Intro Image or Full Article Image form field and use the Select button.
3. Navigate to any folder in the media manager.
4. Upload an image.
5. The newly uploaded image will be ticked to show it is selected.
6. Use the Select button to place the selected image in the edit form.

This functionality works similarly when using the CMS Content -> Media button in the TinyMCE editor, as well as with the media button below the Codemirror editor.
