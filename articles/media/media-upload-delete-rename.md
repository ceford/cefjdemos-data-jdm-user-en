## Simple Media Functions

The simple media manipulation features include Upload, Delete and Rename. At
this stage it does not matter whether you are working with images or files.

## Upload

In the Media screen, navigate to the folder where you want the item to
be located. Note that the media component does not have an option to
move a file to another folder after upload but you can do that with a
system or cPanel file manager.

Select the **Upload** button in the Media Toolbar to open your system
file browser dialog box. Navigate your local file system to select the
image or file you wish to upload. Select the dialog's **Open** button.
After a short delay, depending on its size, the file will appear in the
media list.

### Tips

- Modern digital cameras can take photographs that are enormous. You may
  wish to pre-process images to crop and/or resize before upload. The
  Media component can do that to some extent but sites using inexpensive
  shared hosting may run into memory problems. Aim for final image sizes
  to suit the purpose. If in doubt, no more than 1200 pixels wide.
- If an image with the same name already exists in the folder it cannot
  be re-uploaded. Delete the image first, or rename the image prior to
  uploading.
- You can only upload file types that have been set up in the Media
  Options. Be careful! There are security implications involved in file
  uploads
- Go to Options to change upload sizes and image requirements.

## Delete

Select the item you wish to delete. Select the **Delete** button in the Media
Toolbar or the dropdown menu of the item to be deleted. A dialog box will ask
you to confrim that you wish to delete the selected item.

## Rename

Place the cursor over the item you wish to rename and select horizontal
ellipsis symbol to open the item's manipulation menu. Select the **Rename**
item.

In the Rename dialog enter a new name without the file-type suffix. That
is taken care of for you. Select **Save** to complete the renaming.
