<!-- Filename: Restricting_access_to_%22read_more%22 / Display title: Restrict Access to "Read more" -->

If you create a new menu item of Category Blog or Featured Articles types, a
set of Intro texts with **Read More** links will be displayed on that
page. By clicking on the Read More link you will get to the full article
view. It can be useful to restrict access to the full article view to
registered visitors and leave just the intro texts readable for public viewers.
To restrict access to full article view, proceed as follows:

## Restricting access to Articles individually

- Select **Articles** From the Home Dashboard Site Panel. Or...
- Select **Content → Articles** from the Administrator menu. Then...
- Find and select the article you want to schedule.
- Set the **Access Level** for the article with a Read More link to
    **Registered**.
- Select **Save & Close** in the Toolbar.

Open the Category Blog or Featured Articles menu item.
- In the **Options** tab, set **Unauthorized Links** to **Yes**.
- Select **Save & Close** in the Toolbar.

## Restricting access to Articles Globally

* Set your Category(ies) to view level Public, otherwise menu items
  for the category will not be visible to users that are not logged
  in.
* Set the article(s) in your Category(ies) to view level Registered -
  select articles and use the Batch button.
* Go to **Content → Articles → Options**
* Set **Unauthorised Links** to **Yes** If set to Yes, links to registered
  content will be shown even if you are not logged-in. You will need to
  log in to access the full item.

Optional: Toggle the value for 'Intro Text'
*  **Hide** - hides the intro text when the full article is displayed.
*  **Show** - displays the intro text above the main text when the article is
  displayed.

These options can be overridden by the corresponding menu settings or
by Article settings if the menu settings are set to use the article
settings.

**Note:** Text in an Article without a Read More is treated as all Intro
text. If you have an Article that is supposed to be restricted to Registered
users only but does not have a Read More then the whole article will be visible
to all users. So add a Read More to the article!
