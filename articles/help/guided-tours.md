## Introduction

Guided Tours are designed to give complete newcomers to Joomla a very brief
introduction to the steps an Administrator follows to perform everyday tasks
such as creation of Articles and Categories, Menu Items and so on.

There are a number of built-in tours and the **Welcome to Joomla!** tour starts
automatically the very first time a user logs in to the Administrator
interface.
