## Introduction

The Content Dashboard is accessed via the icon to the right of the
Content menu item. It is a square of four squares. The dashboard
contains three panels corresponding to the three subsections of the
Content menu. These panels cannot be edited or unpublished. The
dashboard may also contain additional panels with information about the
site. New installations show **Popular Articles** and **Recently Added
Articles**. You can add more panels by selecting the **+** icon in the
vacant **Add module to the dashboard** panel.
